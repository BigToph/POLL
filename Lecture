#Create a code that asks the user for two numbers
#Print every number between those two numbers (inclusive)
#If any of the numbers are multiples of 4, print "Fizz" instead of the number

##Assumptions x = "6", y = "12"

x = input("Please print one number" )

y = input ("PLease enter one mumber")

for i in range (int(x),int(y) + 1):
  if((i)%4==0):
    print ("Fizz")
  else:
    print (i)
    
    #float declares a decimal
