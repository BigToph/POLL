##Write a calculator program that asks the user what operation they'd like to do (add/substract/multiply/divide). Following this, the user should be asked how many numbers they would like to use in that operation. The user will be prompted to enter each number, one at a time, and then the code should return the result of the operation

#Example:
#Input: Addition
#3
#1
#2
#1

#Output:
#1 + 2 + 1  = 




#Functions 


def addition (x,y):
  return x + y

def subtraction (x,y):
  return x - y

def multiplication (x,y):
  return x * y

def division (x,y):
  return x/y

##Main

numbers = input("Please enter an opperation you would like to do out of,addition,subtraction, multiplication or division?: " )





if (numbers == "addition"):
  x = int((input("Ok, now enter how many numbers you would like to add.")))
  for i in range (0,x):
    input("Enter an integer you would like to add")
    a = []
    a.append(input("Enter an integer you would like to add"))   
   
if (numbers == "subtraction"):
  x =  int((input("Ok, now enter how many numbers you would like to subtract.")))
  for i in range (0,x):
    input("Enter an integer you would like to subtract")

if (numbers == "multiplication"):
  x = int((input("Ok, now enter how many numbers you would like to multiply.")))
  for i in range (0,x):
    input("Enter an integer you would like to multiply")

if (numbers == "division"):
  x = int((input("Ok now enter how many numbers you would like to divide. ")))
  for i in range (0,x):
    input("Enter an integer you would like to divide")
